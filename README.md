# INet4031 Lab 4 Website

This repository contains a simple, interactive webpage created by Nawal. The page demonstrates how JavaScript can control webpage elementsâ€”in this case, turning a lightbulb image on and off with button clicks. The page is stored locally and can be viewed directly in a web browser without an internet connection. 

The webpage uses declarative HTML to define the structure and appearance, while JavaScript provides interactive functionality. The background color is personalized to light green, and the page text introduces the user to the lightbulb interaction.
